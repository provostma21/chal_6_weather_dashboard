  ## Description
  This project makes use of the open weather api in order to show the user the current temperature and weather in the designated city as well as a 5-day forecast for the upcoming weather. In this project I learned a lot about the process of actually implementing a third-party api as well as just figuring out the data that is returned from the API.

  ## Installation
  No installation required.

  ## Usage
  Under "Search for a City" just type the desired city, click the search button, and there you have it, your forecast.
